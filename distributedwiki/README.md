# Distributed Wiki

A modern cousin of Plone.

You can read about it at [DistributedWiki.com](http://DistributedWiki.com)

With [Sloppy.io](https://sloppy.io)  and the Distributed Wiki, you
can start a wiki, add content, and edit its look and feel all without
using the command line.  More information on how to do that can be found on the
distributed wiki web site. 

But if you do want to start it from the command line, here is how to do it. 

## Start it

```
sloppy start -var=URI:mydomain.sloppy.zone config.json

```
